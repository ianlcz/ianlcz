### Hi there, I'm Yann! ðŸ‘‹

I store my projects there. Most of them are personal projects where I seek to apply the knowledge I have acquired.

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianlcz/) and visit my portfolio website [ianlcz.io](https://www.ianlcz.io/) to read my blog or see some of my major web applications.

In my spare time I like to go __climbing__, watch __fantasy or science-fiction movies__ or just listen to __80s music__. 

### My Setup ðŸ’»

I use a _MacBook Pro 2019_ daily to develop my web applications.

Let's code!
